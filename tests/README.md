# Test Suite for Liger Kernel Gradient Accumulation Fix

This directory contains comprehensive tests that validate the fix works correctly.

## Test Files

### `test_simple_fix.py` 
**Quick validation that original Liger works with gradient accumulation**
- Tests basic functionality
- Compares with PyTorch baseline  
- Verifies mathematical correctness
- **Run first** - this is the main validation

### `test_gradient_accumulation_validation.py`
**Rigorous mathematical correctness testing**
- Tests gradient accumulation step-by-step
- Validates multiple accumulation cycles  
- Ensures mathematical equivalence
- More detailed than the simple test

### `test_stability_comparison.py`
**Training stability analysis**
- Compares stability metrics
- Tests different accumulation steps
- Memory usage analysis
- Performance benchmarking

## Running the Tests

### Quick Test (Recommended)
```bash
python tests/test_simple_fix.py
```
**Expected output:**
```
 SUCCESS!
 Original Liger Kernel works perfectly with gradient accumulation
 The issue was just the overly conservative check in 360-LLaMA-Factory
```

### Full Mathematical Validation
```bash
python tests/test_gradient_accumulation_validation.py
```

### Stability Analysis
```bash
python tests/test_stability_comparison.py
```

### All Tests with Pytest
```bash
pip install pytest
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## Requirements

- `torch>=2.1.2`
- `liger-kernel>=0.6.0` 
- CUDA GPU (recommended for full testing)

## Test Results Interpretation

###  PASS Indicators
- Loss difference < 1e-5
- Gradient difference < 1e-4  
- Training stability maintained
- Memory efficiency achieved

###  FAIL Indicators  
- Mathematical differences detected
- Training instability
- Memory issues
- Performance degradation

All tests should pass with the fix applied. If any fail, please check your Liger Kernel installation and CUDA setup.
